Few examples and experiments of Server-Sent Events with Akka HTTP 2.4.

== Running

.Start the server from SBT console
  reStart

.Start up some listening clients in a few terminals (or create a JS client, too lazy for that!)
  curl http://localhost:9000/sse/subscribe

.Publish some data in another terminal
  http://localhost:9000/sse/publish/test1

You should see the magic happen !
